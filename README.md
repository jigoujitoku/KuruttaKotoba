Kurotta Kotoba means "crazy words" in Japanese.

This is a simple Java based vocabulary game where you connect Japanese kanji in order to form words with meaning.
Select any number characters which are randomly displayed on 4x4 matrix, and submit them. The word is sent automatically to Jisho.org Japanese dictionary and its meaning is displayed.
You can choose between kanji (complex Chinese Japanese characters), hiragan (syllabic, sound mode) and Latin alphabet mode. First two modes will look up the English meaning of the word, while the third mode will yield a Japanese translation of the word.
